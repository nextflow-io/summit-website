title: Training track for Nextflow Summit 2024
---

This introductory course aims to equip participants who are new to Nextflow with foundational skills in two key areas: Nextflow language proficiency and command-line interface (CLI) execution. Additionally, participants will learn to leverage the resources and capabilities offered by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) initiative.

* **Audience:** Beginners (no prior Nextflow experience)
* **Required:** basic experience with command line and scripting
* Some bioinformatics and genomics concepts will be introduced

## Day 1: Getting Started with Nextflow

Participants will be guided through hands-on, goal-oriented exercises that will allow them to develop the following skills:



* Use core components of the Nextflow language to construct simple multi-step workflows effectively.
* Launch Nextflow workflows locally, navigate output directories to access results, interpret log outputs for insights into workflow execution, and troubleshoot basic issues that may arise during workflow execution.

By focusing on these essential skills, participants will be well-prepared to harness the power of Nextflow for their scientific computing needs.


## Day 2: Getting Started with nf-core

Beginning with an overview, participants will explore the collaborative nature of [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) and its significance in bioinformatics research. They will learn how to efficiently access nf-core resources, navigate existing pipelines, and leverage them for various bioinformatics tasks. Hands-on exercises will emphasize the practical aspects of working with nf-core resources, covering topics such as running pre-built pipelines, customizing parameters, and testing pipeline execution with built-in test profiles.

Participants will also delve into the process of developing their own pipelines, guided by nf-core conventions and best practices for using the n on the following topics: using the nf-core pipeline template effectively, ensuring code quality through linting and validation, and collaborating using GitHub for version control and collaborationntribution.
