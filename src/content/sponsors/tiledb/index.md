TileDB is the modern database that integrates all data modalities, code and compute in a single product. 

As a database system, TileDB adapts its internal structure to optimize advanced applications across life sciences, geospatial research, generative AI, and other data science domains. TileDB is architected around multi-dimensional arrays, a powerful structure that adapts to capture any data modality â€” from vectors and tables, to ML models and genomic variants. TileDB provides an ecosystem of open-source tools, whereas its commercial product, TIleDB Cloud, offers a secure platform for distributed computations, interactive analysis, and secure collaboration.
