Mark your calendars, this year’s Nextflow Summit is here! Still unsure about why this event is a “must-attend”? Here are a few reasons to help convince you. 

### Uniting the Nextflow Community

The Nextflow Summit is where connections are made, friendships are formed, and collaborations ignite. Join the hackathon to finally put a face to that Slack username, and work shoulder to shoulder with community experts.

### Inspiring innovation and problem-solving
During the Hackathon, we will defeat complex challenges, push the boundaries of biotech and create pipelines that defy expectations! Prepare to unleash your inner innovator. Here’s the chance to let your imagination run wild, join forces with a team and tackle real-world challenges head-on, using Nextflow.

### You can present your work
