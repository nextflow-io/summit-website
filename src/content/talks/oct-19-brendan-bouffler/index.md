Nextflow has grown significantly in capability since the first Nextflow summit in ’22. AWS has been busy, too, and working with several open-source communities to power activities that are already proving useful to Netxflow users inside and outside their pipelines. We’ll bring you up to speed on some key developments, and talk about the next set of challenges we’re digging into right now where the community could do with your help. And, of course, we’ll solicit your feedback about what we can do to make more of a difference.
