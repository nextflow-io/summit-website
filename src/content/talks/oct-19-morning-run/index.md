**Kickstart your second day with a burst of energy and fresh air!** We're excited to introduce our Sunrise Fun Run - catering to all fitness levels. Whether you're a seasoned marathoner or someone who just enjoys a leisurely jog, this run is designed for everyone.

A professional instructor will guide us through a series of warm-ups and stretches, before and after we hit the track, and will also share tips and help with technique during the run. Not only is this a fantastic opportunity to invigorate your body before the Summit sessions kick in, but it's also a perfect chance to mingle and experience the beautiful morning scenery together.

Join us for this refreshing morning venture. Lace up your sneakers, soak in the ambiance, and let's start the day on the right foot! ðŸŒŸðŸ‘Ÿ

Meeting point will be [Platja del Bogatell](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41%C2%B023'30.9%22N+2%C2%B012'15.4%22E/@41.3919229,2.2036355,203m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d41.3919219!4d2.2042792?entry=tts&shorturl=1)
