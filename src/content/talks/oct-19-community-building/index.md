Developer Advocates act as a connection point between an organization and its developer community. In this talk, Marcel will delve into his experiences and insights gained during one year as a developer advocate for the Nextflow and nf-core communities. Drawing from his journey, this presentation will provide an overview of the strategies, challenges, and discoveries encountered over the last 12 months, and provide recommendations for supporting the growth of developer communities.
