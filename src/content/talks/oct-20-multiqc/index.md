MultiQC is an open-source tool that searches analysis result directories for analysis logs and output files from other tools. It parses and compiles summary statistics into a single Human-readable HTML report and generates results in a standard format for further downstream analysis. Since its release, MultiQC has grown to be one of the most ubiquitous tools in bioinformatics with many millions of downloads and nearly 4000 journal citations.

Whilst MultiQC is not strictly part of the Nextflow ecosystem, it shares its user base and is one of the most commonly used tools within Nextflow and nf-core pipelines. There is a strong interplay with the nf-core community in particular, whose contributors author many new MultiQC modules to support tools being added to pipelines.

When Phil joined Seqera in 2022, he brought MultiQC with him. It has since been taken under the wing of Seqera, with Vlad Savelyev joining the team as a dedicated developer. The speed of development and maintenance has since jumped, with a flurry of activity since Vlad started. In this talk, Phil will describe some recent updates and talk about what users and developers can expect from the roadmap to v2.0.
