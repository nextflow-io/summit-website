DNA comprises molecular information stored in genetic and epigenetic bases, both of which are vital to our understanding of biology.  Genetics & the DNA epigenome play a causal role in cell fate, ageing, response to environment and disease development.  biomodal Duet is a single base-resolution sequencing protocol that simultaneously  provides complete genetics and cytosine methylation.  This enables precise measurements of allele-specific methylation (ASM), whereby differential methylation is traced to differences between maternal & paternal alleles.  I will present the protocol & computational methods that underlie this new technology, how key diagnostics compare with the field and the significant detection of this unique signal at scale.
