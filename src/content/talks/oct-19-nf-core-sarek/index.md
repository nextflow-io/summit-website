High-throughput, efficient, and reproducible pipelines are needed to ensure homogeneous data processing across different compute infrastructures with affordable resource usage.

We present nf-core/sarek 3.x, to explore single-nucleotide variants, structural variation, microsatellite instability, and copy-number alterations of germline, tumor-only, and tumor-normal pairs.

We will emphasize our efforts to reduce computational resource requirements including CRAM usage, replacing tools, and improving the scatter/gathering approach which ultimately lead to a reduction in cloud computing costs by 70%. In addition, we recently made efforts to include Sentieon for even faster processing as well as expanding nf-core/sarek with more tools to allow for post-variant calling and post-annotation processing.
