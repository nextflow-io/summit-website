The nf-core community values results. One of the most important steps in producing accurate analyses is incorporating reproducible and scalable testing within your workflows. First we'll reflect on the beginning of testing at nf-core, then dive into the evolution of testing starting with the need for a testing framework, examine the introduction of modules, and understand the adoption of pytest-workflow. Next, we'll go over how nf-test has been amazing for testing full pipelines, their subworkflows and local modules. We'll examine some highlights such as snapshots, tags and the CI configuration. Finally, we'll talk about nf-core modules, and the necessity to support legacy pytest-workflow tests as we transition to nf-test. We'll also go over the progress made during the hackathon on nf-test.
