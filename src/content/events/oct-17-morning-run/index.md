Kickstart your second day with a burst of energy and fresh air! Weâ€™re excited to introduce our Sunrise Fun Run - catering to all fitness levels. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned marathoner or someone who just enjoys a leisurely jog, this run is designed for everyone.

A professional instructor will guide us through a series of warm-ups and stretches, before and after we hit the track, and will also share tips and help with technique during the run. Not only is this a fantastic opportunity to invigorate your body before the Summit sessions kick in, but itâ€™s also a perfect chance to mingle and experience the beautiful morning scenery together.

Join us for this refreshing morning venture. Lace up your sneakers, soak in the ambiance, and letâ€™s start the day on the right foot! ðŸŒŸ ðŸ‘Ÿ
