Characterization of circulating cell-free DNA can reveal normal and pathological processes occurring in different organs throughout the body. Whole-genome cfDNA sequencing can be used to detect cell-type and disease-specific markers including fragmentation patterns and chromatin signatures, copy number alterations, and differential DNA methylation. We are harnessing Nextflow/nf-core and the Microsoft Azure cloud environment to implement both standard and customized analyses for cfDNA WGS. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges of implementing such a framework, including the use of the Tower workflow management system.
