Flow is a web platform for analysing sequencing data at scale using nf-core pipelines. Using Flow, a researcher can upload data, analyse it using robust, community-verified nf-core pipelines, and easily share their results. All analyses run on Flow are linked to their underlying data files and can be shared publicly, making Flow a public database of sequencing data in addition to an analysis tool, to create a true community-driven analysis platform. Unlike other analysis tools, Flow is backed by open-source Nextflow pipelines, requires no command-line or programming knowledge to use, and has convenient domain-specific data structures for organising data, such as samples, lanes and projects. We also introduce nextflow.py, the Python interface to Nextflow pipelines which powers Flow. Flow is a collaboration between Goodwright and Professor Jernej Ule's lab at the Dementia Research Institute.
