With increasing numbers of human omics data, there is an urgent need for adequate resources for data sharing. Within the federated European Genome Archive (EGA), GHGA strives to provide the necessary infrastructure for Germany as well as an ethico-legal framework to handle omics data in a data-protection-compliant and open and FAIR manner.

GHGA will build on cloud computing infrastructures managed in a network of data generators. Based on GA4GH standards, researchers will have controlled access to raw and processed sequence data using recognized analysis workflows. For this, GHGA is joining the nf-core community to co-develop GA4GH-compliant workflows for data analysis, benchmarking, statistical analysis, and visualizations.
In addition to infrastructure, GHGA is working on ethical and legal aspects of data sharing. This includes consent guidelines, which can be applied when enrolling patients into studies and help decide if existing data can be shared.
