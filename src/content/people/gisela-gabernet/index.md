Gisela Gabernet is a Team Leader for Research & Development in Data Science at the Quantitative Biology Centre, a Bioinformatics Core facility of the University of Tübingen, Germany. Her team focuses on developing Nextflow pipelines for various NGS data analysis tasks, which are also part of the nf-core project. She is a core member of the nf-core community since 2020.

Gisela Holds a PhD in computer assisted Drug Design from the ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Her research interests lie at the interface between high throughput data science analysis methods and pipelines that can be applied to gain insights into large-scale healthcare projects, especially in the areas of oncology and immunology. She has co-developed - among others - nf-core/airrflow (https://nf-co.re/airrflow), a Nextflow pipeline for high-throughput analysis of B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor sequences, with applicability in the study of (auto)immune diseases and cancer immune therapies.

Gisela will be presenting her work titled "nf-core/airrflow: a pipeline to analyze Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoires (AIRRs)".
