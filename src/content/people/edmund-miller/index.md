Edmund Miller is a Bioinformatics Associate at Element Biosciences. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cell Biology from the University of Texas at Dallas where he is developing nascent transcript identification analysis and viral genome integration. Most recently he has been working on architecting analysis methods and bioinformatic workflows, across multiple genomics assays tuned specifically to the AVITI platform, Element Biosciences’ first entry into the NGS market.

Edmund will be presenting his work that he has been collaborating on with Bryan Lajoie titled “Workflow automation: using the Aviti benchtop sequencing system and Nextflow Tower”.
