Ricardo is a Software Engineer that transitioned to become a PhD in Plant Sciences. All this trough the lenses of bioinformatics. He worked in the automation of pipelines for a sequencing centre back in the early 2010s, so had his good fights with LSF and batch. Now he is working in the migration of clinical workflows to Nextflow.
