Cristina is a Bioinformatics Scientist at Flomics Biotech SL, where she works developing pipelines (with Nextflow and with the help of nf-core community!) to make bioinformatics analysis accessible to all kinds of users. She is also interested in research on cancer diagnostics using cell-free RNA, liquid biopsies, and biomarker discovery. She is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedicine centered around these topics, and using Nextflow to carry out all the analysis. 

Cristina will be presenting her work titled “Building the Flomics bioinformatics infrastructure from the ground up”.
