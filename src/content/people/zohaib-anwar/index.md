Dr. Zohaib Anwar is a member of the Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health (CIDGOH) group at FHS. His research interests pertain to applying cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics technologies to study infectious diseases caused by bacterial and viral pathogens.   Dr. Anwar is part of the Computational Analysis, Modelling, and Evolutionary Outcomes (CAMEO) initiative of the Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net). CAMEO aims to use computer modeling and simulations to evaluate the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and how quickly they propagate in the Canadian population. 

Dr. Anwar also contributes to pandemic preparedness by developing genomics workflows to analyze priority pathogens.   Anwar is also a co-investigator with the Pandemics and Borders Project, deploying genomic analyses to understand and evaluate the use of cross-border measures, notably travel and trade restrictions, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dr. Anwar will present a talk titled "Moving from pandemic response to preparedness: Leveraging Nextflow to build VIRUS-MVP framework".
