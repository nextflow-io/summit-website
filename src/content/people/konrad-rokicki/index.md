Konrad Rokicki leads the software engineering group at Janelia Research Campus, where his team has been establishing the use of containerization technologies and workflow systems for improving the portability and reproducibility of large-scale microscopy image analysis. He holds an M.S. in Computer Science from George Washington University.

Years of experience supporting scientific research informatics has made Konrad an enthusiastic proponent of accessible and reusable scientific software. He is a co-founder of Janeliaâ€™s Open Science Software Initiative, which is driving the development and maintenance of user-friendly and developer-friendly software for applications in neuroscience and 4D cellular physiology. Konrad is also the software architect and lead developer for several large software projects at Janelia including NeuronBridge, HortaCloud, and Janelia Workstation. He has built Nextflow pipelines for spatial transcriptomics, neuronal circuit reconstruction, and animal behavioral analysis.

Konrad will be presenting his work titled "Large scale image processing with Nextflow".
