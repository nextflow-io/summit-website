Luisa is a PhD student at the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona. She is a part of the Comparative Bioinformatics Lab, where she focuses on developing multiple sequence alignment tools. She is a bioinformatician by training, starting with a Bachelors's in Bioinformatics at TUM in Munich followed by a Master's in Bioinformatics at the UPF in Barcelona.  During her studies, she also visited the computer science department of the City University of Hong Kong during a semester.  Before delving into method development, she dedicated two years to a research project at the Barcelona Computing Center (BSC) where she investigated lncRNA expression at the single-cell level, with a focus on its dynamics upon Ebola infection.

Luisa will present a poster titled "nf-core/msa: A pipeline to run and systematically evaluate Multiple Sequence Alignment methods".
