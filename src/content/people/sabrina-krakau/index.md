Sabrina Krakau is a Team Leader for Research & Development in Data Science at the Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC), the bioinformatics core facility of the University of Tübingen in Germany. She and her team develop Nextflow and nf-core pipelines for the analysis of NGS data.   Sabrina did her PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, where she developed computational methods to capture protein-RNA interactions from CLIP-seq data. In 2019 she joined QBiC and since then she contributed to multiple nf-core pipelines. She is a main developer of nf-core/mag, a pipeline for metagenome assembly and binning, and nf-core/metapep, a pipeline to predict and compare HLA peptidomes from microbiome data. Recently, she also works on a Nextflow plugin to estimate the CO2 footprint of pipeline runs.

Sabrina will present a talk titled "nf-co2footprint: a Nextflow plugin to estimate the CO2 footprint of pipeline runs".
