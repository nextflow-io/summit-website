Christopher Cheshire is a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Francis Crick Institute in the Briscoe lab. He holds a PhD In Genetics and Bioinformatics from the UCL, UK.

Chris is currently attempting to resolve the gene regulatory networks that control early spinal cord development using novel single-cell multi-omics.  To achieve this, he is developing new experimental protocols using custom microfluidics, novel chemistry and state-of-the-art analysis pipelines written in Nextflow.

Chris will be presenting his work titled "nf-core CUT&RUN - A comprehensive analysis pipeline for targeted antibody-based chromatin assays".
