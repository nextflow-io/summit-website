Starting off with a bachelor in Biology and delving into computational biology during my master studies, Jasmin is now a doctoral researcher in the department of Paleobiotechnology at Leibniz-HKI Jena, Germany, since fall 2020. Here, Jasmine focuses on resistance gene evolution and since efficient genome mining is crucial for that, developing nf-core/funcscan evolved as part of the plan!

Jasmin will be presenting her work titled "nf-core/funcscan: Identifying natural products and functional gene clusters in ancient microbial DNA".
