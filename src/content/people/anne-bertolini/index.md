Anne is studying biology with a focus on Bioinformatics as much as the program allowed. Working as a Bioinformatician ever since, she is excited to see how new experiments and technologies emerge, and grateful to be part of such a vibrant and friendly community.

Anne is presenting a poster titled "Nf-core for tailored clinical research data analysis – challenges and use cases".
