Solenne Correard is a postdoctoral fellow in the Wasserman lab, at the Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics (CMMT), University of British Columbia situated at the BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, in Vancouver, Canada.

Solenne is a molecular biologist and bioinformatician passionate about the complexity of human and non-human genomes, convinced that genomics can help navigate some of today's worldwide challenges, such as ensuring equal access to personalized medicine to everyone around the globe, regardless of their origin or economic background.

She did her PhD in France studying the dog genome (mostly the non-coding part) to find and characterize variants implicated in neurological disorders. She then joined the Wasserman lab in 2019 to work on the Silent Genomes Project, a project aiming to reduce health care disparities and improve diagnostic success for children with rare genetic diseases from Indigenous populations in Canada. Within this large project, Solenne focuses on the development of the Indigenous Background Variant Library, which is a database of DNA variants present in a group of people without severe genetic conditions, to help filter out frequent variants in patients affected with rare genetic disorders.

Solenne will be presenting her work titled "A workflow to generate a variant catalogue from Whole Genome Sequences".
