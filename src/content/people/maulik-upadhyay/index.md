Maulik completed his joint Ph.D. in Animal breeding and genetics from Wageningen University, Netherlands, and SLU, Uppsala, Sweden. After completing his PhD, he has been working as a post-doctoral researcher (Bioinformatics) in the population genomics group in the Department of Veterinary Sciences at LMU, Munich. His research area includes population genomics of livestock, and identifying the genetic basis of Mendelian traits in cattle, sheep, and goats. In his spare time, he enjoys writing code in python and Nextflow!

Maulik will present a poster titled "Scalepopgen : bioinformatics workflow resources for population genomics".
