Sejyoti pursued an M.Tech program that opened the doors to an enriching exchange program at the prestigious Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in November 2022. Under the mentorship of Dr. Mohit Kumar Jolly, she delved into the fascinating realm of cancer research, working with diverse cancer datasets, including TCGA, CCLE, bulk RNA sequences, microarray datasets, and single-cell RNA sequences. Her primary objective was to develop an automated pipeline capable of determining the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) score of cancer cell lines, a critical process implicated in cancer progression.

Following the completion of my M.Tech dissertation, she embarked on a new chapter in my career as a Bioinformatician at BioxploreLabs in May. In her current role, she actively engages in Metagenomics and Transcriptomic analysis projects, utilizing programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL to extract meaningful insights from intricate biological data. One of the exciting projects she is currently involved with at BioxploreLabs is lncRNA analysis in cancer cell lines. By integrating RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing data, she aims to determine the enrichment levels of desired histone PTMs/histones in differentially expressed genes.

She is enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that lie ahead and eagerly anticipate making meaningful contributions to solve complex biological challenges in the days to come.
