Simon Heumos is a PhD student at the Biomedical Data Science Department and the Quantitative Biology Center in Tübingen. In his undergraduate studies, he worked on methods to interactively visualize variation graphs. Currently, he is exploring methods to calculate and visualize pangenome graph layouts. Already, these are key steps in pangenome graph construction pipelines like nf-core/pangenome and pangenome graph analysis tools like ODGI. He is also interested in sequence to graph mapping, multiomics, and opening pangenome graphs to the semantic web. A huge sesame street fan.

Simon will present a talk titled "Cluster scalable pangenome graph construction with nf-core/pangenome".
