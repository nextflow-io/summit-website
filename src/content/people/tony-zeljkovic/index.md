Tony has a passion for breaking Byzantine legacy thinking and delivering bioinformatics solutions that scale, automate and accelerate.

He is Specialised in providing end-to-end solutions for bioinformatic applications of next generation sequencing technologies in biotech, healthcare and academia.

He implemented several (bioinformatics) applications leveraging AWS, infrastructure as code, snowflake containerisation, database change management, git and of course nextflow. He has worked with a variety of stakeholders to deliver on various types of datasets such as RNA/DNAseq, 16S sequencing, amplicon sequencing, whole genome sequencing on Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms.

At Curative, he’s passionately contributing to the mission of building infrastructure to make essential health services easier to access for everyone. Curative's infrastructure is designed to change as the world does—offering nearby access, affordable services, and science-based guidance.

Before working in industry, he has worked at several academic institutions. He developed statistical simulators for optimisation of highly multiplexed CRISPR screens at the Systems Genetics and Precision Health/Steinmetz Lab at the Stanford genome Center. At the university of Amsterdam, he has worked with neurotranscriptomics sequencing data on a Ion Proton sequencer.

Tony will be presenting his work titled "Unlocking automated bioinformatics for large scale healthcare".
