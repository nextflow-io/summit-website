  Stephen works in the Product Management team at Oxford Nanopore and is responsible for bioinformatics solutions. Working with a number of different internal teams, we develop and support a collection of tutorials and nextflow based pipelines for the analysis of Nanopore sequence data. Our content is all open-source (EPI2ME Labs) and we provide tools for running workflows on the desktop and in the cloud.

  Stephen will be presenting his work titled "EPI2ME Labs and democratising Nanopore sequence analysis".
