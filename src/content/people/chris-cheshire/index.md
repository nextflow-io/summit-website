Chris Cheshire is a Postdoctoral fellow in James Briscoe's developmental dynamics lab at the Francis Crick Institute. His primary focus is the study of gene regulatory network dynamics during early embryonic development. More specifically, he is developing novel single-cell multi-omic protocols and bioinformatic tools that will enable researchers to study these networks in unprecedented resolution. He is also an active contributor to the nf-core community where he maintains the CUT&Run and ClipSeq pipelines.

Chris is presenting a poster titled "nf-core/cutandrun:  A Nextflow pipeline for analysis of CUT&Run, CUT&TAG and TIP-Seq datasets".
