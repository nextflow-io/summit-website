Helen is undergoing registration to become a Clinical Scientist – Bioinformatician at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust. Her background is in Biomedical Sciences (BSc), Bioinformatics (MSc) and academic research in cancer genomics (PhD and post-doctoral positions). The Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust leads the Central and South Genomic Laboratory Hub (GLH), in the UK. The Central and South GLH encompasses four trusts, and serves a broad geography, covering the West Midlands, Oxfordshire, the Thames Valley and Wessex, and sequences samples for diagnostic, prognostic and treatment stratification purposes, for cancer and rare disease patients to cover a population of ~18 million people. The alliance of all UK GLHs aims to provide access for genetic and genomic testing for our patient population, by working in collaboration with partner organisations, involving patient and public experts, to bring genomic medicine to the heart of patient care. 

The bioinformatics team develop pipelines and web apps for the interpretation of genetic variants within solid cancers, haematological cancers, hereditary cancers, and rare diseases.

Helen will be presenting a talk titled "Using nextnlow in healthcare: A non-invasive prenatal diagnosis pipeline".
