Louis is a PhD genomic bioinformatician with a passion for open science and FAIR data. His research focuses on developing and applying computational methods for analyzing genomic data. He is particularly interested in using open-source tools and workflows to ensure reproducibility and facilitate data sharing.  One aspect of his research focuses on the creation of user-friendly R packages to streamline the visualization of pedigree data using Kinship2 and simplify the development of R shiny apps through BioShinyModules. These packages provide researchers with efficient resources to explore and present their genomic findings in a visually appealing manner. Additionally, as an active member of the nf-core community, he contributes to the establishment of best practices for next-generation sequencing data analysis. Specifically, he is dedicated to advancing the utilization of imputation tools for low-depth genomic data. By collaborating with fellow researchers, they strive to enhance the accuracy and reliability of imputation techniques in genomic studies. The main objective of his research project is to unravel the genetic basis of hip dysplasia in dogs, utilizing them as a model for the developmental dysplasia of the hip in humans. Through comprehensive genomic analyses and innovative computational approaches, they aim to identify key genetic factors contributing to this condition, ultimately paving the way for improved diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.

Louis will present a talk titled "nf-Core pipeline for Genomic Imputation: From Phasing to Imputation to Validation".
