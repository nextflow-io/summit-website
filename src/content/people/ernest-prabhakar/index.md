Computational science was in its infancy when Ernie purchased a used NeXT Cube in 1989, on which he both analyzed and wrote his Physics Ph.D. thesis at Caltech. This vision of integrated data presentation bounced him from management consulting to Apple, where drove adoption of UNIX and Open Source for seventeen years. He spent seven years chasing that dream at seven startups before landing as Director of Product at Quilt Data.

Ernest will be presenting his work titled "One Link to Rule Them All".
