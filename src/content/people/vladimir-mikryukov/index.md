Vladimir Mikryukov is a molecular ecologist with special interests in ecological genetics, biodiversity, and metagenomics. He earned his Ph.D. by studying the phylogeography and population genetics of lichen symbionts, and later explored bacterial and fungal community dynamics, as well as their roles in forest ecosystem stability. As a bioinformatician and biostatistician, he investigated the effect of long-term disturbances on the phylogenetic diversity of various biological communities. Currently, his research focuses on the factors driving the global distribution of microbial functional diversity in soil, using metagenome sequencing. Vladimir is a research fellow in the Ecology of Biological Interactions Workgroup at the Department of Botany, Institute of Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Tartu.

Vladimir will present a poster titled "SH-Matcher: towards identification and communication of taxa through species hypotheses".
