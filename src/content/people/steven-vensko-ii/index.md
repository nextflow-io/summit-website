Steven graduated with a PhD in Genetics in 2015. While at NC State, his research concerned MSL complex-mediated dosage compensation within Drosophila. Specifically, he focused on how dosage compensation influenced the genetic composition of the X chromosome and how levels of dosage compensation vary among tissues throughout male individuals.  Steven then worked at Q2 Solutions/Expression Analysis in Durham, NC as a Bioinformaticist and Team Lead. Steven’s work at Q2 Solutions focused on guiding his team through the development of both research-oriented and regulated software under rapid turnaround times.  Steven currently works in Dr. Benjamin G. Vincent’s lab at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. His focuses are writing software that promotes reproducible bioinformatics and developing workflows for neoantigen prediction.

Steven will present a talk titled "Enabling Reproducible and Flexible Neoantigen Prediction with Nextflow".
