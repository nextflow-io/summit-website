I am an associate professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Maryland. Before joining the Computer Science department at UMD, I was an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at Stony Brook University, from 2014 â€” 2019. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate working with professor Carl Kingsford in the Lane Center for computational biology (now the Computational Biology Department) at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, and defended my dissertation, Computationally Comparing Biological Networks and Reconstructing Their Evolution. My main research interests are in the design of algorithms and data structures for processing, organizing, indexing and querying high-throughput genomics data. I am also interested in the intersection between efficient algorithms and statistical inference. More broadly, I am also interested in programming languages, computer graphics, scientific visualization.

Rob will be presenting a keynote titled "What could be next(flow): Workflows as augmented execution contexts to improve provenance tracking and interoperability".
