Phil Ewels is Lead Developer Advocate at Seqera Labs, working on strengthening the Nextflow and nf-core communities. He holds a PhD in Molecular Biology from the University of Cambridge, UK.

Before joining Seqera in 2022, Phil worked at the the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden. He and his team focussed on developing and scaling up new lab protocols and bioinformatics solutions. This involved developing new analysis pipelines that could scale to very high volumes whilst adhering to high standards of reproducibility and reusability. It was through this work that Phil became involved in the Nextflow project and eventually co-founded the nf-core community.

Philâ€™s career has spanned many diciplines from lab work and bioinformatics research in epigenetics, through to software development and community engagement. He is passionate about open source software and has a soft spot for tools with a focus on user-friendliness. He is the author of MultiQC, SRA-Explorer, QCFail.com and several other pet projects.
