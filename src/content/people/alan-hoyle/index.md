Alan Hoyle is a bioinformatics scientist who was an undergrad at UNC and never left.  After years working on the campus learning management systems, he shifted to working at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and has developed and modified workflows for investigators.  He has worked on large scale projects like TCGA, small projects for individual students and investigators, and made some tiny contributions to well-known third-party tools.  

After years of using a locally-developed workflow runner, eventually gluing containerization to the back end of it, and then dabbling with another commonly-used workflow language, a colleague found Nextflow and the team has never looked back.  

Alan will be presenting his work titled "jUNCtion: Let investigators turn their data into results".
