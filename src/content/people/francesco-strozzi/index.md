During his career Francesco worked at the crossroad between academia and industry, primary in the genomics field. He is very passionate about biology and technology, and since 2005 he focused on the development of data analysis pipelines and the application of computational methods to high throughput data, to drive translational and pre-clinical research projects in a wide range of contexts from biotechnology, to immunology and drug discovery.
 
He participated and contributed to several open-source projects under the Open Bioinformatics Foundation umbrella, including the BioRuby project and some Google Summer of Code projects. Since 2016 he joined Enterome where he is now the Head of the Bioinformatics and Data Science team, focused on the development of the next generation of biopharmaceuticals targeting oncological and inflammatory diseases.
