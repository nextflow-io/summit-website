Jose is a Bioinformatics PostDoc working within the Comparative Bioinformatics group at the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona. His journey in bioinformatics began with a degree in Biology, specializing in Microbiology from Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB). Following this, he ventured into the industry as a programmer before pursuing my passion for bioinformatics by completing the Bioinformatics master's at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). Subsequently, he obtained his Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from CRG. Having completed a post-doctoral position at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB), he returned to the Comparative Bioinformatics group in 2020. His current focus lies in developing and scaling up bioinformatics pipelines for the BovReg consortium under the umbrella of the FAANG project. He is committed to incorporating best practices in computational reproducibility and interoperability within our pipeline development. As an early adopter of Nextflow, he actively contribute to the nf-core community, striving to advance bioinformatics pipelines and promote collaborative research efforts. These efforts crystallized into becoming a core member of the community. With a passion for reproducible bioinformatics, he is eager to share our latest developments and findings at the Nextflow summit, contributing to the advancement of genomic research and bioinformatics practices.

Jose will be presenting a talk titled "nf-core/proteinfold: A standardized workflow framework for protein structure prediction tools".
