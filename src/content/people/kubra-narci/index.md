Dr. Kübra Narcı is a bioinformatician at German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). Based at the DKFZ in Heidelberg, Kübra works on the processing of data and the development, standardization, optimization, and maintenance of the bioinformatic workflows using mainly Nextflow. Before moving to Germany, she obtained her PhD in Medical Informatics at METU,Turkey. There, she developed a methodology to perform a pathway-based analysis with a series of expression profiles from cancer data using a nonconventional network analysis strategy, differential expression analysis, clustering approaches, and visualizations.  During her Ph.D., she also worked for Seven Bridges Genomics. There, her main research was on population studies. She was one of the main bioinformaticians in the initial phase of the Turkish Genome Project. Afterward, she was also involved in the methodology development for improved variant calling methodology using graph strategies. The work was shown to be advantageous over especially less studied populations like in Africa.

Kübra will be presenting a poster titled "Standardizing and harmonizing NGS analysis workflows in the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive".
