Nextflow, the product and the community, has grown significantly in capability and use-cases since the first Nextflow summit in ’22. AWS, similarly has a long tradition of scaling and accelerating research workloads in the cloud, working with open-source communities to power activities that are proving useful to Nextflow users. In this talk, we will talk about use cases on how AWS has helped the Nextflow community leverage the cloud and present some key recent developments. We will also discuss the next set of challenges we’re digging into where the community could do with your help.
