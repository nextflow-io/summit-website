The Seqera Platform is a full-stack application for the management of data pipelines and compute resources. It enables collaborative data analysis at scale, on-premises or in any cloud. The Seqera Platform CLI interacts with the Seqera Platform, providing an interface to launch pipelines, manage cloud resources and administer your analysis.

Harshil will introduce a new Python package, which is a wrapper tool for the Seqera Platform CLI. It can be leveraged to automate the creation of all of the entities on the Seqera Platform via a simple configuration file in YAML format, as well as invoking the Seqera Platform CLI directly from within Python.
