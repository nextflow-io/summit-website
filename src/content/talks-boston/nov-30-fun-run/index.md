**Kickstart your second day with a burst of energy and fresh air!**Â Weâ€™re excited to introduce our Sunrise Fun Run & Walk - catering to all fitness levels. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned marathoner or someone who just enjoys a leisurely walk, this activity is designed for everyone.

A [**professional instructor**](https://teamrunrun.com/coach/sam-munnelly-boston-running-coach/) will guide us through a series of warm-ups and stretches, before and after we hit the **[route](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IMamWFTlSiEvxGu5ldst5PMCVMz6YqRL/view?usp=sharing)**, and will also share tips and help with technique during the run. Not only is this a fantastic opportunity to invigorate your body before the Summit sessions kick in for the day, but itâ€™s also a perfect chance to mingle and experience the beautiful morning scenery together.

For those who wish to walk instead, we will in the beautiful [**Public Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5Ze5iZwkiW7KsK4SA)** â€” the first botanical garden in the US.

Join us for this refreshing morning venture. Lace up your sneakers, soak in the ambiance, and letâ€™s start the day on the right foot! ðŸŒŸðŸ‘Ÿ

The meeting point will beÂ in the main lobby of the [**Boston Park Plaza Hotel**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4bujB388qHhJWfxe9). The instructor will walk everyone over to Boston Common where we can do stretches/warmups (more room and away from traffic).

ðŸ’¡Dress appropriately for **colder weather** ðŸ¥ŠðŸ¥¶
