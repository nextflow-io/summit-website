The nf-core hackathon takes place in the days leading up to the Nextflow Summit. Community members new and old come together to work on community projects. Teams include Pipelines, Modules & Subworkflows, Infrastructure, and – for the first time – Nextflow development. This year’s hackathon is the largest event that we have run, with nearly 100 participants joining in-person at the Hotel SB Glow in Barcelona, and many more online.

In this talk, Phil will recap some of the highlights and achievements – expect stats, group selfies, new nf-core memes, and perhaps even some special prizes!
