ZS Discovery is a practice area within ZS Associates that works closely with Pharma and Biotech to advance their early R&D capabilities. In our talk, we describe how our partnership with Seqera helps us do this by leveraging Nextflow to create end-to-end data solutions to solve complex biological problems. 

We will present an example of collaborative research, where we contributed to the nf-core Single-Cell RNA-seq pipeline in addition to customizing it to our clientâ€™s needs. As part of this effort, we developed client-specific modules and infrastructure connections, while contributing to bug fixes and enhancements to the nf-core public repository.
