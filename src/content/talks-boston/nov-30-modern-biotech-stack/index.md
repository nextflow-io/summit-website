Seqera makes complex data analysis accessible at any scale. Beginning with the deep knowledge of high-throughput analysis and automation gained from building Nextflow, we released the Seqera Platform to make data-intensive research scalable, flexible, and collaborative. The Seqera Platform consolidates fragmented data and diverse computing resources into a unified control plane, enabling teams to rapidly develop, test, and deploy together while maintaining deep insight into resource usage and leveraging tools for intelligently scaling. Seqera is modern software engineering â€“ for science.
